# MA-20 - Battleship - 1rst year   
   
## What's the project ?   
   
The project was to create a Battleship with C language after 3 months of practice.   
We learn to create sprints, organisations stuffs and also Github!   
For that project we were having 3 months, approximately.   
   
## Did my game works ?
   
Yes, but not all the settings are available, like the score page.   
I'm proud of me for that first game project in C.   
   
### The code is free to use !!   
If you use it, huh.
